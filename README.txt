Video Automation Project - README
Overview
This project automates the generation of short videos using a combination of text scripts, images/videos, and voice-over audio. It dynamically creates video scenes by overlaying subtitles onto backgrounds and synchronizing them with AI-generated or user-provided voiceovers.

Features Implemented
Script-based video creation: Uses a structured text script to generate scenes.

Dynamic background selection: Fetches images/videos automatically or allows user-provided media.

Auto subtitle generation: Converts the script into text overlays.

AI-generated voice-over: Uses text-to-speech for narration (replaceable with user audio).

Timeline-based video merging: Ensures smooth scene transitions and synchronization.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Required libraries:

pip install moviepy gtts requests
Setup Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-url>
cd video-automation
Ensure dependencies are installed:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:

python main.py
How It Works
1. Input Data
Script.txt: Contains scene descriptions and subtitles.

Media (Images/Videos): Can be auto-fetched or user-provided.

Audio: AI-generated or user-uploaded voice-over.

2. Processing
The script is divided into scenes.

Backgrounds are assigned (either fetched dynamically or taken from local storage).

Text overlays (subtitles) are generated and placed on scenes.

Voice-over is created or synced if provided.

Video scenes are merged into a final MP4 output.

3. Output
The final video is saved as output.mp4.

Future Enhancements
API Integration for Media & Voice: Support for Unsplash, Pexels, and ElevenLabs for better voice generation.

Custom Voice Modulation: Ability to modify pitch, speed, and tone.

Advanced Animations & Effects: Implement transitions, zoom effects, and motion graphics.

GUI Development: User-friendly interface for non-coders to input script and generate videos easily.
