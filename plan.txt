Begin integrating simple manual controls (e.g., parameters for adjusting style).
Deliverable: A working adaptive template prototype with basic manual override options.
Week 11:
User Testing:
Present the template outputs to users for feedback.
Iterate on style presets and transition rules.
Deliverable: Revised SmartTemplate configuration based on user feedback.
Week 12:
Documentation & Checkpoints:
Set clear milestone deliverables and validation checkpoints for the template system.
Deliverable: A milestone report detailing the adaptive template system’s performance and user acceptance.
Phase 4: Real-time Preview System & Iterative Integration (Weeks 13–16)
Goals:

Develop a PreviewEngine for rapid, low-resolution scene previews.
Integrate preview capabilities early to allow iterative refinement.
Tasks & Deliverables:

Week 13:
PreviewEngine Development:
Implement the PreviewEngine class using FFmpeg or a lightweight rendering library for fast previews.
Deliverable: A basic preview function that outputs low-res previews.
Week 14:
Integration with Templates:
Connect the PreviewEngine with the SmartTemplate and AI-generated scenes.
Deliverable: A preview module that displays scene previews based on current template settings.
Week 15:
User Feedback:
Conduct early testing sessions where users review previews and suggest adjustments.
Deliverable: User feedback report and list of improvements.
Week 16:
Optimization:
Optimize preview rendering speed and accuracy.
Deliverable: A refined, fast, and representative real-time preview system.
Phase 5: Media Handler & Video Processing (Weeks 17–20)
Goals:

Automate media processing: manage assets, synthesize voice, and assemble video segments with FFmpeg.
Tasks & Deliverables:

Week 17:
Asset_Manager Module:
Develop scripts to catalog and pre-cache assets (images, video clips, audio files).
Deliverable: An Asset_Manager that reliably retrieves and organizes media.
Week 18:
Voice_System Integration:
Integrate voice-over files generated by your TTS module with corresponding scene segments.
Deliverable: A module that synchronizes voice files with scene metadata.
Week 19:
Video_Processor Module:
Create the FFmpeg-based video processor to assemble clips, apply transitions, and overlay text.
Build dynamic command strings based on scene data.
Deliverable: A working video assembly prototype that outputs test video segments.
Week 20:
Integration & Testing:
Integrate Asset_Manager, Voice_System, and Video_Processor.
Run end-to-end tests on sample projects.
Deliverable: A validated automated video processing module with clear quality benchmarks.
Phase 6: Manual Interface & Output Manager Integration (Weeks 21–24)
Goals:

Develop robust manual override controls alongside the automated system.
Finalize the process for compiling and rendering the final video output.
Tasks & Deliverables:

Week 21:
Manual_Interface Module:
Develop initial manual controls and editor integration (e.g., basic GUI with PyQt or a web-based interface).
Deliverable: A prototype manual override interface allowing users to adjust scene order, transitions, or quality settings.
Week 22:
Output_Manager Development:
Implement functions to compile processed media into a final video, applying quality presets and export profiles.
Deliverable: A module that outputs a final video file using predefined quality settings.
Week 23:
Integration & Checkpoints:
Integrate manual controls with the automated pipeline, ensuring smooth handoffs between auto and manual adjustments.
Deliverable: A fully integrated system with user-adjustable parameters and clear checkpoint validations.
